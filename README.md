# Hi there, I'm Musab Kasbati 👋

I am a **Computer Science student at Habib University** focused on the union of High-Performance Computing, Differentiable Simulations, and Machine Learning. I enjoy solving complex algorithmic problems and building systems that bridge theoretical research with practical implementation, and sharing my learning journey through technical content on YouTube.

### 🚀 What I’m Working On
* **Scientific Computing:** Developing **TurboDiff**, a differentiable fluid solver for airfoil optimization using JAX and XLA.
* **LLM Research:** Exploring model alignment through reinforcement fine-tuning (GRPO) and efficient model compression (Pruning + Quantization).
* **Distributed Systems:** Investigating distributed load-balancing algorithms on tree topologies.

### 🛠️ Featured Projects

#### [TurboDiff](https://github.com/FYP-M4-Fluid-Simulator/TurboDiff)
A high-performance, differentiable inviscid flow solver built from scratch. It utilizes **JAX for Automatic Differentiation** to compute exact discrete adjoints, enabling rapid convergence in aerodynamic shape optimization.

#### [Explorable-Heap-Selection](https://github.com/musab1blaser/Explorable-Heap-Selection)
An implementation of a randomized algorithm for heap selection with logarithmic memory usage, based on the **IPCO 2023 paper**. I identified and corrected a flaw in the original proposed algorithm during implementation.

#### [MR_Proj_SLAM-Navigation](https://github.com/musab1blaser/MR_Proj_SLAM-Navigation)
A **ROS2 implementation** for a differential drive robot. It features autonomous navigation and SLAM capabilities in unknown environments.

#### [DynamicTrees_NF](https://github.com/musab1blaser/DynamicTrees_NF)
A deep dive into advanced data structures, specifically implementing and visualizing **Sleator-Tarjan Link-Cut Trees** to optimize network flow and tree operations.
